# type_speed
TUI application to compute typing speed

## TODOS:
- Endless generation of words (maybe generate fixed size impossible to type in 1 min) [a-zA-Z]{2,10}
- Read dynamically user input without need to press <CR>
- Highlight common substring (read about terminal colors)
- Move generated string and user input by word after each <Space> or <CR>
- Create a timer for 1 min
- Add possibility to set dynamic timer (1, 3, 5 mins etc.)
- Generate real words based on dictionary
- Add possibility to dynamically set the generator (lowercase ascii, uppercase ascii, digits, special symbols, subset of specific chars)
- Collect statistics and save them (think about format: JSON, DB, custom binary protocol, or something else)
- Draw graphs based on statistics in WEB
